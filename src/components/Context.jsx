In the House, voters elected <span onClick={this.selectPartyFlippedOff} id='democrat'>295 Democrats</span>, up from 258 in 1962, for a majority of 295 to 140.  <span onClick={this.props.onDistrictSelected} id='025088090009'>John McCormack</span> (D-MA) retained the Speakerâ€™s gavel, while <span onClick={this.props.onDistrictSelected} id='026089092005'>Gerald Ford</span> (R-MI) became the Minority Leader.

          <p>Divisions in the Democratic Party and a more marked sorting of racial conservatives into the Republican Party contributed to losses in each chamber in the 1968 election, where Republicans picked up 5 seats from Democrats.
