This isn't quite answering the questions I asked (which I'll add again) to get at Johnson's arguments about race. This still needs revision to summarize Johnson's argument about how and why race was not just (or maybe even) used in the slave market but made in it.

On chapter 5 you're summarizing how, according to Johnson, buyers thought about and attempted to use race in the slave market. There's another key part of the argument that you're not quite getting at: how these ideas had no basis in fact (e.g. there is not corrolation between darker skin pigmentation and health). Which begs two questions: where did these fictional ideas come from and why did slaveholders use them? (Put another way, did these and how did these ideas about race advantage them?) I think the answers to these questions and, in my view, Johnson's key arguments in this chapter are expressed most directly around pages 155-157.
